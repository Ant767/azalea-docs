Azalea has recently removed old sidebar and chat formats and has added a new system, go check it out!  (released in versions 2.2+)

New default chat rank formats:

{{has_tag staffchat "<bc>[<nc>StaffChat<bc>] " "<bl>"}}§r<bc>[{{rank_joiner "<drj>"}}§r<bc>] §r<nc><name> §r<bc><dra> §r<mc><msg>

For the sidebar, the format is shown in the admin panel.

We've added this to make it easier for users to setup stuff to their liking, these new formats can almost be used everywhere across the add-on!
